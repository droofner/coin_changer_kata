First I opened two file 
One was for coin changer homework which I'll put the code in.
The second was for the coin chamger homework test where I'll run some mini test linked to the code in the first file to see if the code works. 
In my code file I'm defining the method of making change.
My varible for change is set to an empty {} hash.
I want to test for zero cents to return an empty hash. It did.
Now I want to test for one cent to return a hash with one penny
so I wrote an if statment say if cents is >0 the change hash would be a penny with is equal to one cent.
I ran the test and it worked.
